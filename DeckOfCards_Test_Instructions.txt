Deck of Playing Cards
 
This goal of this programming exercise is to write a simple C# console application which manages a deck of cards.
 
A deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards which each have:
 
•             A suit (either clubs, spades, diamonds, or hearts)
•             A value (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace). Note that Joker cards are excluded from this test.
 
The deck of cards should have only one instance of a particular combination of suit and value (e.g., there can be only one Ace of Spades and one Nine of Diamonds).
 
Tasks
 
1.            Write some code that models a deck of cards and:
 
a.            When initialised populates the deck with 52 new cards
b.            Allow for a card to be removed from the deck - Once the card has been removed from the deck it should not be returned again.
c.             Support a shuffle function which randomises the deck
d.            Support a sorting function which sorts the deck
 
2.            In the main application
 
a.            Create a deck of cards
b.            Select 10 random cards from the deck and print them to the console
c.             Shuffle the deck and print entire deck to the console
d.            Select 10 random cards from the deck and print them to the console
e.            Sorts the deck by suit and then number, print the entire deck to the console
f.             Select 10 random cards from the deck and print them to the console
